The Hydro API is a REST API for applications to interface with the Hydro Smart Contract.

All Hydrogen APIs are built on REST principles, with resource oriented URLs and HTTP response codes. All API responses are returned in JSON format.

We provide a free sandbox environment to test our APIs before going into production. Please [sign up now](https://www.hydrogenplatform.com/sign-up) to request your keys.
