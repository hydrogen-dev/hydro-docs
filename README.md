## The official Github page for important Hydro documents including whitepapers
As the Hydro ecosystem continues to evolve, the global development community will be releasing whitepapers for all major phases: Raindrop, Snowflake, Ice, Tide, and Mist.

A final version of the [Raindrop Whitepaper](./Raindrop) is complete. Drafts of the [Snowflake Whitepaper](./Snowflake) and [Ice Whitepaper](./Ice) are posted and available for review and comment by the global Hydro community. In the future, you can look forward to the Tide and Mist whitepapers. The global Hydro community may even have a few more products that are yet to be announced 😏.
